# Genome Informatics (BMEG 424/524) – Assignments

Welcome to the assignment repository for **Genome Informatics (BMEG 424/524)** at UBC.

This course explores the intersection of genomics and informatics, focusing on how large-scale genomic data can be transformed into meaningful biological insights. With a strong emphasis on practical skills and critical thinking, Genome Informatics equips students with the computational tools and conceptual frameworks necessary to tackle real-world problems in genomics research.

## 🧬 Course Overview

**Genome Informatics** is designed to:
- Build a mental framework for analyzing genomics problems
- Introduce the structure and function of the human genome
- Teach experimental design and computational analysis of genomic data
- Explore common challenges in genomics such as gene regulation, mutations, and phenotype associations
- Apply theory through guided assignments and an independent or collaborative final project

The course encourages students to **"learn how to fish"**—emphasizing problem-solving and learning through practical application. 

## 💻 Course Structure

### 📚 Lectures
- Focused primarily on theoretical concepts
- Cover foundational knowledge in genomics and informatics

### 📝 Assignments (~6 Total)
- Programming-based (mostly Bash and R), plus written components
- Emphasize applying theory to practical data analysis problems
- Can be completed individually or in pairs (self-selected)
- Submissions are made via private GitHub repositories

> ⚠️ Start early! Some steps in the assignments may require hours of compute time.

### 🧪 Project
- Recreate a published genomics analysis or perform your own on a dataset of your choosing
- Done individually or in pairs
- Encourages creativity and independent inquiry

### 📊 Quizzes (BMEG 424 Only)
- Unannounced, in-class, short quizzes based on recent lecture material
- Must achieve 60% average or take an oral final exam

### 📢 Presentation (BMEG 524 Only)
- Students present a specialized genomics technique not covered in lectures
- Topics are self-selected and ranked via survey

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand the major components of the genome and how they affect phenotype
- Be able to design, analyze, and interpret genomics experiments
- Know how to apply computational methods to derive insights from large-scale genomic datasets

## ⚖️ Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is taken very seriously. All work must be your own or appropriately cited, including the use of generative AI tools. Misconduct may result in penalties ranging from zero on assignments to disciplinary action at the faculty level.

## 🌐 Tools Used
- Bash (Linux shell scripting)
- R (statistical computing)
- GitHub (assignment submission and collaboration)
- ChatGPT/other AI tools (allowed with proper disclosure)

## 🧑‍🏫 Instructor & TA

- **Instructor:** Carl de Boer – Assistant Professor, SBME  
- **TA:** Omar Tariq – Researcher in transcription factor binding and mutation effects
